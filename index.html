    <h1>HISTORY OF NIGERIA</h1>
    <h2>What was Nigeria before it was called Nigeria?</h2>
    <p>Before Flora Shaw suggested the name Nigeria, other competing names included "Royal Niger Company Territories", "Central Sudan", "Niger Empire", "Niger Sudan", and "Hausa Territories".</p>
    <h3>How did Nigeria began?</h3>
    <p>On January 1, 1914, Lord Frederick Lugard, the governor of both the Northern Nigeria Protectorate and the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria, signed a document consolidating the two, thereby creating the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. Forty-six years later in 1960, Nigeria became an independent state.2 Jan 2018</p>
    <h4>What are 2 history facts about Nigeria?</h4>
    <p>Modern Nigeria dates from 1914, when the British Protectorates of Northern and Southern Nigeria were joined. The country became independent on October 1, 1960, and in 1963 adopted a republican constitution but elected to stay a member of the Commonwealth.</p>
    <h5>What is the oldest tribe in Nigeria?</h5>
    <p>There has been much argument about which tribe in Nigeria is the oldest. The Ijaws started inhabiting the Niger Delta region of what is now Nigeria as far back as 800 BCE, thus making them one of the world's most ancient peoples. They have existed as a distinct language and ethnic group for over 5000 years.</p>
